# Human Limb Motion 
The simulation of human movements and the optimization of these models are often used in biomechanics and robotics to better understand complex movements in terms of motor strategies. 

In this repo, I present the simulation of the motion of a human upper limb.
This model considers 3 joints (shoulder, elbow and wrist) and 8 muscles. The corresponding limbs are the arm, the forearm and the hand.
